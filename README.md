# Inventory App

This app is being designed to track the inventory in my freezer. Items will be able to be added, edited, retrieved, and deleted. It is being built with the intention of being mobile friendly, and may be exported to Android and iOS applications in the future. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.5. There is currently no backend setup or being used in this project -- all data is being stored in a Firebase Database with the frontend handling all interactions.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
